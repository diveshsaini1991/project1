                was the first Indian Army officer to be promoted to the five-star rank of Field Marshal.<br> <br>
                * His father initially opposed his plans to join the Army, but he rebelled, 
                claiming that his father should send him to London in that case so he can become 
                a gynaecologist. His father refused. Following that, Manekshaw took the Indian 
                Military Academy entrance examination and the rest is history.<br> <br></p>
